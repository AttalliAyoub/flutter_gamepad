# flutter_gamepad

A platform library for listening to hardware gamepads (game controllers) from Flutter.

**Currently supports iOS only. Android coming soon!**

## Features

* `FlutterGamepad.eventStream` reports gamepad events.
* Fractional button values, such as those reported by the left and right trigger buttons on most gamepads, are supported.
* Supports iOS 13+, as well as older versions of iOS.
* Supports multiple simultaneous gamepads. Events are tagged with an ID you can tell gamepads apart by.

## Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gamepad/flutter_gamepad.dart';

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  StreamSubscription<GamepadEvent> _gamepadEventSubscription;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _gamepadEventSubscription = FlutterGamepad.eventStream.listen(onGamepadEvent);
  }

  void dispose() { _gamepadEventSubscription.cancel(); super.dispose(); }

  void onGamepadEvent(GamepadEvent e) {
    if (e is GamepadConnectedEvent) {
      // ...
    } else if (e is GamepadDisconnectedEvent) {
      // ...
    } else if (e is GamepadButtonEvent) {
      // ...
    } else if (e is GamepadThumbstickEvent) {
      // ...
    } else throw ArgumentError('Unknown event: $e');
  }
}
```
